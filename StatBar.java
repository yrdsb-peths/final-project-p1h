/**
 * New and Improved Stat Bar (Formerly Health Bar). This stat bar may have customized colors,
 * can hide when at full, and can have a customized border. This class aims to be as flexible
 * as possible, allowing it to be simple to use for beginners (easy 0 or 2 parameter constructor)
 * while also highly flexible for those who want to provide more specific parameters (multiple bars
 * in custom colours and sizes with custom offsets and borders).
 * <p>
 * Implementation - If using multiple bars, all arrays must be the same size. To 
 * optimize the appearance choose a height such that:
 * <p><code> (height - (borderThickness * 2)) % numBars == 0  </code></p>
 * <p>In other words, after factoring out the border, the size should be evenly divisible by 
 * the number of bars, so that all bars end up the same size.</p>
 * <p><b>Version Notes:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Now has a boolean to determine whether it will hide itself when Val is full.</li>
 * <li>Now has a set of constructors to allow simple and complex implementation.</li>
 * <li>2.1.0 --> Added a border feature, allows customization of thickness and colour</li>
 * </ul>
